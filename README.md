This 3-person project was a part of Computer Engineering Esstential.2017
The main goal of the project is to create a mouse using arduino board that utilizes any sensors that we could find.
The mouse has a specific objective which is to compete against other group in a Counter-Strike(FirstPersonShooting game) contest.
#### Disclaimer: Since this project was assigned when the students don't have knowledge in network system or nodeJS. The server.js (mouseServer) 
was given to the students and the students was taught briefly about how does it works and how to use it.

### Please read the projectReport.pdf 
The project Report contains the overview of the project including what sensor did we use and how the mouse works.
### There is also a video for project presentation by me.

#### What did I learn?
I did mostly the coding for the arduino including connecting arduino to a wifi,get the input from the sensors and try to stabilize the value to
offset unintended movement and increase smoothness,how to use 3D model design and sending requests to server.
